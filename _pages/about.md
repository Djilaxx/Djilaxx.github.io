I'm Djillali Hadmoussa, a french Data scientist that graduated  in Economic Engineering from the University of Cergy-Pontoise which consisted mostly on Economics, Econometrics, Quantitative Finance & Data analysis methods. \

Since my graduation i got really interested in ML/DL and worked on many things related including NLP, computer vision, GANs... \
I notably worked on a re-implementation of many Generative network algorithms (including DCGAN, SNGAN & WGAN) for fake pokemon generation. I also worked on some Kaggle competition mostly to learn new things in sentiment analysis, Q&A, image classification & segmentation, sound classification. 

I'm currently looking for a Data scientist position in France. \
